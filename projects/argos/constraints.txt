# Resolver anchors used by CI across Linux/macOS/Windows.
# NOTE:
#  - Torch/TorchVision pins were removed here to avoid blocking +cpu local wheels
#    when the CPU index is used. Torch pairs are selected by requirements + bootstrap logic.
#  - NumPy floor raised so TorchVision 0.20 CPU wheels resolve cleanly.

# OpenCV wheels (GUI-capable on all platforms)
opencv-python==4.11.0.86

# NumPy: allow NP2 across Pythons (Torch/Tv CPU wheels require >=2.1)
numpy>=2.1,<2.3

# Sympy/Scipy pins to satisfy Torch and ONNX tools landscapes
sympy==1.13.1
scipy==1.13.*

# Matplotlib: cap on Py3.9 only to avoid wheel gaps
matplotlib>=3.9,<3.10  ; python_version < "3.10"
matplotlib>=3.10       ; python_version >= "3.10"
